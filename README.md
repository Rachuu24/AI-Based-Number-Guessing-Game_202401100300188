AI based number guessing game
In this number guessing game, the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number. With each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
How It Works-
1. Generate a Random Number:
Use the random library to generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

2. Initialize Game Variables:
Create variables to track the number of guesses and store the player's guess.

3. Game Loop:
Use a loop (like a while loop) to allow the player to keep guessing until they find the correct number.
Inside the loop, prompt the player to enter their guess.
Compare the player's guess with the randomly generated number.
Provide feedback: if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

4. End the Game:
When the player guesses the correct number, congratulate them and display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
